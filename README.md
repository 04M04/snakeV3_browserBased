# snakeV3_browserBased

snakeV3 is a browser based javascript implemented multiplayer snake. 
Until now it only works for 2 players even if I have implemented more players in the background. 
Before I want to implement the remaining game functions, I want to implement the p2p multiplayer aspect of the game. 
For this I want to use PeerJS which is a nice litle thing to use for p2p implementation in almost every language. 
Controller support is also implented partly, because I had not that much time for this hobby project. 

For the future I want to rewrite this game in TypeScript for type safty, because with time and when all the code is implemented to live up to my expectations, it's going to be big.

Try it out! I will host it some time in the future. (in days, weeks, months, years or neverðŸ˜…)
I will keep you guys up to date. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‹
